To build a breakfast ordering website for employees, hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan with recommended technologies:

1. Front-end (UI Development)
React.js: For building the user interface, React will provide a dynamic and responsive experience. Components can handle the menu, order forms, and real-time updates.
Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap: To style the website quickly and make it mobile-responsive, Tailwind or Bootstrap is recommended for streamlined and visually appealing designs.
Authentication: For logging in employees, you can use:
Firebase Authentication or Auth0: Simplifies managing user login with social sign-ins, username, and password.
Custom user management in React if using a back-end server for authentication.

2. Back-end (API and Database Management)
Node.js with Express.js: For building the back-end API, Node.js with Express is lightweight and allows quick creation of RESTful APIs to handle data like orders, employees, and menu items.
Database: To store employee data, orders, and menu items:
MongoDB: For a NoSQL approach to manage unstructured data, like orders with various items.
PostgreSQL/MySQL: If you prefer SQL for structured data, this will also work well.
Daily Recording: Schedule a daily job using Node.js cron or Heroku Scheduler to record all orders in the database at the end of each day.

3. Key Features to Build
Employee Login/Registration: Each employee can log in and see the menu.
Menu Creation: A list of breakfast items with prices and options for customization.
Order Form: Each employee selects their breakfast items, the quantity, and submits their order.
Order Summary: For each employee, display their order, total cost, and delivery fees.
Collect Orders: At a given time (e.g., daily), the system gathers all orders, calculates the total cost (including delivery), and displays a final summary.
Admin Panel: Optional feature for an administrator to manage the menu and see the collected daily orders.

4. Data Flow
Employees select their orders, which are saved in the database.
A back-end service collects all orders at the end of the day.
The total cost, including delivery, is calculated and displayed for each employee.
Orders are stored in the database daily for records.

5. Technologies Summary
Front-end: React.js
Back-end: Node.js with Express.js 
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL) 
Authentication: Firebase Authentication or Auth0
Deployment: Netlify for hosting, with daily database storage for orders.
This plan ensures scalability, good user experience, and smooth data management. Let me know if you want specific examples or additional features!
